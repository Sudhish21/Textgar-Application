About
When we start living in a new place, one common problem we may face is to find a good cloth store or textile shop. We have to collect information from our neighbors. Our neighbors may say their preferred one, but there may be so many better options than they suggested textile stores.
To overcome this, we are introducing our application which is called Textile and Garment stores Application. Our application has multiple search options like in various forms of wear (Party wear, Traditional wear, Fashion wear, Sportswear, Formal wear, Business casuals) and places. As per now, we are going to implement a Web Portal application in Educational areas.

This Web portal application can be accessed using any device having internet connections. The website is user friendly and allows you to select an occasion for your wear. According to the chosen occasion it searches for the best clothes from the shops nearby. Once the shops are located, it displays the shops on the website with the contact details. One can easily book the dress sitting at home or try it out in the shop to check the fittings. The website also organizes sales and provided discounts both seasonal and festive.
